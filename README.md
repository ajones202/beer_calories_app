# Project Name 

Beer Calories App

## Project Description

This app is designed with the health-conscious bar-goer in mind. It will solve the problem of not knowing the amount of calories in each type of beer. The user will be able to select the brand of beer and view all of the nutritional information related to it. The user will also be able to add, update and delete the list.

## User Stories

 Oftentimes, health and fitness-conscious individuals also enjoy being social. Typically, there are no posted calorie counts for tap beers. With an easy-to-use interface, my app will provide users a one stop shop to uncovering nutritional information for tap beers.

 Although, many active individuals are well aware of the hard work which goes into burning off the calories in an alcoholic beverage, it may not be immediately apparent how much of a particular activity is required to "negate" the caloric content of common craft beers on tap.
